- [[Beats]] tend to be grouped into consistent patterns throughout a passage -> meter is that pattern.
	- Groups of 2, 3 and 4 beats are the most common.
	- A group of four beats could also be interpreted as 2 groups of two beats (and vice versa).
## Number of beats in a measure
- **Measures**: the groups of beats - the end of a measure is indicated with a bar line.
- **Duple, triple, quadruple meter** -> meter type: number of beats in each measure/how the measure divides.

	- Associated with each meter is its own pattern of *metric accents*.
- Examples:
	- Most marchers are in duple meter since people have 2 feet.
	- Contemporary pop are often in duple or quadruple.
- *"Meter is a matter of interpretation rather than of right or wrong."*
## Division of the beat
- Simple/Compound -> beat type: how a beat is divided.
	- Simple meter: when beats are divided into 2 parts.
	- Compound meter: when beats are divided into 3 parts.
- Seriously it can sound the same, but slightly different..
## Naming meter
- We combine beat type + meter type:
