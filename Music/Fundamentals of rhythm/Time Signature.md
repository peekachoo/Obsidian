- Time Signature tells:
	- How many beats there are in a measure.
	- The value of each beat.
	- Simple/Compound [[Meter]].
## Simple Time Signature
- In simple beat:
	- Top number: number of beats (2/3/4)
	- Bottom number: beat duration (always undotted notes).

## Compound Time Signature
- If the beat is divided into 3 equal parts -> note value of the beat will be a dotted value -> then what the hell would the time signature be?? 2/4.5?
- In compound time signature:
	- Top number: number of divisions (6/9/12)
	- Bottom number: division duration (always dotted notes).

- You can tell what the top number of the time signature is (by recognizing the beat and the meter types by ears).
- But to know the bottom number you have to look at the score.
