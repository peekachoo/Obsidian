- Form the circle of fifths:
	- Start from C, go up or down a fifth ([[Interval]]).
	- C go up a fifth is G... -> these are major keys.

- Notice the overlapping keys, if two keys are not enharmonic, they are [[Transpositions|transpositions]] of each other.
- Relatives: major/minor keys that feature the same note as their counterparts - therefore share the same key signature.
	- 3^ of a minor is 1^ of its relative major.
	- 6^ of a major 1^ of its relative minor.
	- Ex: Am has the same all white notes as C.
- Parallels: major/minor keys that share the same 1^.
	- Ex: C major and C minor.
