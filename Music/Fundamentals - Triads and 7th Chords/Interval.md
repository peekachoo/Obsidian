# Definition
- Interval: distance between 2 notes.
# Types
- Harmonic interval: notes played at the same time.
- Melodic interval: notes played successively.
# Interval Name
- There are 2 parts: Modifier/Quality + Numerical name/Number
## Numerical name
- Numerical name: how far apart the 2 notes are on the staff (regardless of accidentals).

- Odd-numberred intervals: always be in line-line or space-space

- Even-numberred intervals: always be in space-line or line-space.

- Spelling: unison (1) -> 2nd -> 3rd -> ... -> octave/8ve (8).
- Intervals < 8ve are **simple intervals.**
- Intervals > 8ve are **compound intervals**.
## Quality
- Modifier: perfect(P), major(M), minor(m), augmented(+), diminished (Â°). ... 
- Perfect(P): unison, 4th, 5th, 8ve.
- Major/minor: 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th.	
- Tritone: ...
# Interval Inversion
- When we invert an interval (putting the bottom pitch above the top one).
- Ex: A-D -> D-A
- In this case, the numerical name will change. We can calculate it by:
	- 9 - (old number) = (new number)
- Modifier is changed too (except for P):
