* A 32-bit [[processor]] can deal with instructions and referencing memory locations of 32 bits.
* 2^32 = 4,294,967,295 -> 32-bit processor can only access a maximum of 4GB of memory.
* 64-bit processor version of Windows an access 8TB of RAM. While today's PC and laptops generally have 8, 16, 32GB of RAM -> 64-bit processor is capable of much more.
